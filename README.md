# Bryn - Primes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `to do (with more time)`

- refactor easier to read code, more es6 syntax
- improve the test e2e (simulate N as 3, we render a grid of 16)
- look into performance, for example N=60 takes 4.3s to render (profiler - WithStyles)

### `Happy with`

I happy with the overall simplicity (we can always refactor)
Works well as a small app (this test didn't really need branches or extra components)
My solution achieves a few results, for example a function that returns multi dimensional array but it also used to render the grid.

### 'Thanks'

Thanks for reviewing my work, there are many application you could build here, I really enjoyed this exercise. I look forward to your feedback.
